0.5 (2011-03-30)
----------------

- The default value for the ``cookie_on_exception`` parameter to
  ``pyramid_beaker.BeakerSessionFactoryConfig`` is now ``True``.  This means
  that when view code causes an exception to be raised, and the session has
  been mutated, a cookie will be sent back in the response.  Previously its
  default value was ``False``.

0.4 (2011-01-08)
----------------

- Allow cache regions to inherit URL configuration from main cache options.

- Respect a ``cookie_on_exception`` configuration value passed to the
  ``BeakerSessionFactoryConfig`` constructor.  If this value is passed and
  it's not false, session cookies will be set even on responses resulting
  from an exception.

- Update to new relationship between ``new_csrf_token`` and
  ``get_csrf_token`` as described in Pyramid 1.0a9 interfaces.

0.3 (2010-12-29)
----------------

- Support ISession flash/csrf API added to Pyramid 1.0a8+.

0.2 (2010-11-27)
----------------

- Add cache_region support via
  ``pyramid_beaker.set_cache_regions_from_settings`` (and documented).

- Initial release.
