unreleased
----------

 - Fixed a bug causing session saving even when it is not needed. See
   https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_beaker/pull/28

0.8 (2013-06-28)
----------------

- On Python 3, the CSRF token returned by new_csrf_token was a bytestring
  instead of correctly being a string.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_beaker/pull/12

- A new argument to PyramidBeakerSessionFactoryConfig named
  ``constant_csrf_token`` is now permitted for test configuration purposes.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_beaker/pull/13 for more information.

0.7 (2012-07-10)
----------------

- Python 3.2 compatibility.

- Dropped Jython support (may be re-added after Jython releases a 2.7-
  compatible version).

- Dropped Python 2.5 support.

- Made compatible with zope.interface 4.0.0 (symptom: ``TypeError: Class
  advice impossible in Python3.  Use the @implementer class decorator
  instead.`` when run under Python 2 or *or* Python 3)

- Add ``dev`` and ``docs`` setup.py aliases.

0.6.1 (2011-11-19)
------------------

- Beaker 1.6+ compat: added support for ``key_length`` and ``enabled``
  options.

0.6 (2011-11-12)
----------------

- Add a tox.ini for Jenkins testing.

- Add includeme function to ease application setup.

0.5 (2011-03-30)
----------------

- The default value for the ``cookie_on_exception`` parameter to
  ``pyramid_beaker.BeakerSessionFactoryConfig`` is now ``True``.  This means
  that when view code causes an exception to be raised, and the session has
  been mutated, a cookie will be sent back in the response.  Previously its
  default value was ``False``.

0.4 (2011-01-08)
----------------

- Allow cache regions to inherit URL configuration from main cache options.

- Respect a ``cookie_on_exception`` configuration value passed to the
  ``BeakerSessionFactoryConfig`` constructor.  If this value is passed and
  it's not false, session cookies will be set even on responses resulting
  from an exception.

- Update to new relationship between ``new_csrf_token`` and
  ``get_csrf_token`` as described in Pyramid 1.0a9 interfaces.

0.3 (2010-12-29)
----------------

- Support ISession flash/csrf API added to Pyramid 1.0a8+.

0.2 (2010-11-27)
----------------

- Add cache_region support via
  ``pyramid_beaker.set_cache_regions_from_settings`` (and documented).

0.1

- Initial release.
